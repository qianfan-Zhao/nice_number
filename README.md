nice number
===========

There has a version code in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8506881/nice-label-algorithm-for-charts-with-minimum-ticks),
it was wrote by JAVA, So i write anthor version of C.


> When creating a graph by computer, it is desirable to label the x and y axes with "nice" numbers: simple decimal numbers. For example, if the data range is 105 to 543, we'd probably want to plot the range from 100 to 600 and put tick marks every 100 units. Or if the data range is 2.04 to 2.16, we'd probably plot a range from 2.00 to 2.20 with a tick spacing of 0.05. Humans are good at choosing such "nice" numbers, but simplistic algorithms are not. The naÃ¯ve label-selection algorithm takes the data range and divides it into n equal intervals, but this usually results in ugly tick labels. We here describe a simple method for generating nice graph labels.

> The primary observation is that the "nicest" numbers in decimal are 1, 2, and 5, and all power-of-ten multiples of these numbers. We will use only such numbers for the tick spacing, and place tick marks at multiples of the tick spacing...

## BUILD, TEST

	$ gcc nice_number.c -o nice_number -lm
	$ ./nice_number -0.085 0.173 10
	num: 0.050000, min: -0.100000, max: 0.200000
	-0.100000 | -0.050000 | 0.000000 | 0.050000 | 0.100000 | 0.150000 | 0.200000 |
